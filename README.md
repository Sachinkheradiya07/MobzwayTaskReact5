# MobzwayTaskReact5
Added drag-and-drop task management using `react-dnd`. Created `Task` and `DroppableBox` components for rendering and managing tasks within different categories. Implemented state updates to move tasks between lists, ensuring tasks are correctly removed from their original list and added to the target list on drop.
